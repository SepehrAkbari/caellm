# caeLLM

This is a personal project where the goal is to build an LLM from the ground up, starting from scratch. The purpose is to deepen my understanding of the architecture and mechanics through hands-on implementation, without relying on high-level libraries. The process, including trials, errors, and basic solutions, will be documented here in separate notebooks.
